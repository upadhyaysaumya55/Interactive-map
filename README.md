Interactive Map
---------------

A React + Vite project where I am building an interactive map.  
The project allows users to explore locations, zoom in/out, and interact with map markers. It demonstrates practical usage of React with mapping libraries (OpenLayers) for geospatial data visualization.

Features
--------
- Display an interactive map
- Zoom and pan functionality
- Add markers for specific locations
- Popups showing location details
- Responsive and user-friendly design

Tech Stack
----------
- Frontend: React, Vite, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Styling: CSS / Tailwind CSS
- Mapping Library: OpenLayers

Getting Started
---------------
Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed on your system
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)

Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/upadhyaysaumya55/interactive-map.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd interactive-map

3. Install dependencies:
   npm install

4. Start the development server:
   npm run dev

Usage:
- Open the URL shown in the console (usually http://localhost:5173)
- Explore the interactive map, click markers, and use zoom controls

Learnings
---------
- Advanced Frontend Development: Deepened understanding of React, event handling, and state management
- Geospatial Integration: Implemented OpenLayers to work with coordinate systems and location data
- Responsive Design Challenges: Maintained map functionality across different screen sizes
